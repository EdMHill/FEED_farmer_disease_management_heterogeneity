## Corrections to the publication 

### 27 November 2024

Within the livestock disease model code there was a bug identified with the cell-to-cell distance calculation.
Rerunning the analysis with the amended cell-to-cell distance calculation, there was no change in the qualitative findings. There were marginal changes to the quantitative results. Updated versions of the main manuscript and supporting information are available.

 A correction has also been published by *Preventive Veterinary Medicine*: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2024.106408.

 ### 06 April 2025
Within the livestock disease model code there there was an implementation error in the conditional subsampling algorithm used to model the spatial transmission of infection. Rerunning the analysis with the amended code, our previous qualitative conclusions are unchanged. There were changes to the quantitative results, mainly a reduction in the outbreak sizes. Updated versions of the main manuscript and supporting information are available.

## Livestock disease model 

The livestock disease model simulations are performed using the programming language Julia.
Julia makes use of environments, allowing bespoke package lists for separate projects. Documentation on working with environments and installing packages in the same state that is given by the project manifest: https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/#Using-someone-else's-project

The livestock disease model analyses in the paper require holding location and demographic cattle data that are not publicly available. We instead provide synthetic cattle demography data for Great Britain, with the number of holdings matching the number used in our analyses, albeit randomly located in a 1000kmx250km region. This enables the user to run the main simulation script (run_GB_livestock_disease_spatial_model.jl). Note the results produced using the synthetic data do not match those from the paper.

We provide results files that allow the user to run the associated results scripts.
